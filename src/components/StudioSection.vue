      We want the stage to be occupied and crazy ideas being tried out.
      Therefore, we are building two 6x5 rehearsal studios, in the building next
      to the caf√©. We provide a place for you to rehearse and try out with your
      band. Looking for such a place? Contact us and we'll show you around!
